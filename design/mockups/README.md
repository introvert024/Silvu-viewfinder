SILVU VIEWFINDER — Hi‑Fi Mockups and Prototype

Files:
- index.html — Launch this in a browser to view the Hi‑Fi mockup (responsive container for 1366×768 and 1920×1080)
- styles.css — Theme tokens and layout styles
- style-tokens.json — JSON file with colors, spacing, and type tokens
- logo.svg — App logo used in mockup
- drone.svg — Placeholder drone graphic used in the 3D viewport
- controls.js — Small script for play/pause/timeline demo

How to view:
1. Open `design/mockups/index.html` in your browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox). The page contains two viewports: 1366×768 and 1920×1080 look previews — use the toggle to switch.

How to export PNG screenshots (quick):
- Open the mockup in Chrome and use DevTools → Device Toolbar → set the viewport to desired size, then right-click → "Capture screenshot".
- Or take a full-window screenshot using the OS screenshot tool.

If you want, I can add a tiny script using Puppeteer to automatically render PNGs at both sizes and commit them to the repo.
